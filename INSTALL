INSTALL
=======

0. Compile
----------
You need: 
* glib
* libsecret
* libmongo-client
* loudmouth

Install them, then just run 'make'.

1. Install the GSettings schema
-------------------------------
$ cp prj.NekoGroup.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
$ glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas

2. Configure it as you like
---------------------------
In a desktop environment, you can simply use 'dconf-editor' to go 
through /prj/NekoGroup.

In CLI, you can also use the 'gsettings' tool to configure it.

Be careful. You are supposed to configure your NekoGroup under the 
same user who runs NekoGroup.

2.1 Password storing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can simply write your passwords unsafely in the settings. However,
you can also choose a safer way we have provided.

Firstly, turn off the 'unsafe' option.
$ gsettings set prj.NekoGroup.Server unsafe false

Secondly, let 'NekoGroupPasswordHelper' guide you to store your passwords.
$ cd password-helper/
$ make                                  # you may want to do this

Running 'NekoGroupPasswordHelper' without any arguments will print the 
currently stored passwords. You will see '(null)' if you haven't set 
the password.

Running 'NekoGroupPasswordHelper --remove' will delete your passwords.

Running 'NekoGroupPasswordHelper --setter-mode' will save your passwords.
* --db-password : password of the database
* --server-password : password of the account on which NekoGroup works
MongoDB doesn't have any users or passwords by default. In this case,
you could use '--db-password ""' to avoid authentication.

3. Run your server
------------------
Firstly start the MongoDB. And then run 
$ mongod &                              # if you care about security,
                                        # you may want add a password
                                        # for MongoDB.
$ ./NekoGroup
Enjoy!
