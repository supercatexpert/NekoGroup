- New information and control pad, client-side decoration
- Move configuration files to ~/.config/RhythmCat2
- Move user plug-in files to ~/.local/share/RhythmCat2/plugins
- Player Command Interpreter build in LibRhythmCat
- Use desktop.in

Long-term:
- Command Line Interface (CLI), based on ncurses
- Mini mode (plug-in?)
- More plug-ins
- Non-Unix platform support
- More interfaces in MPRIS v2.1 support
- Multi-touch support
- New icon and default cover image.
- Make a GTK+ 2 port for legacy systems (Will be RhythmCat 1.4.x).

Other ideas:
- Better karaoke mode plug-in?
- Vala support
